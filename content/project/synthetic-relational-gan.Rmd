This research project explores **synthetic data generation** using advanced variants of GANs applied to **relational-sequential time series data**, extending the **Row-Conditional Tabular GAN (RCTGAN)**.

We designed three architectures:

- **Sequential RCTGAN** using LSTMs to capture temporal dynamics
- **Mini-batch GAN** inspired by DoppelGANger to improve long-sequence realism
- **FFT-Enhanced GAN** leveraging frequency-domain signals to enrich temporal dependencies

We applied our models to the Rossmann dataset, evaluated autocorrelation, cross-correlation, and parent-child metadata consistency, and achieved improvements over baseline CTGAN models in preserving long-term structure.
