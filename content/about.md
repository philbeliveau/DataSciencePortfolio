With a background in data science and economics, Iâ€™ve conducted applied research in generative AI and time series forecasting, alongside real-world business roles such as AI product ownership and cash flow analytics. 

I'm particularly passionate about deep learning, sequential decision-making, and building models that reflect the operational realities of users. I thrive in unstructured environments where technical curiosity meets real business value.
